# Ansible_LDAP-Configuration
Given Vagrant and Ansible, create a Vagrant file which creates two virtual machines, and an Ansible playbook which configures the VMs as an openldap server and openldap client.  A user must be able to successfully log into the client via LDAP authentication.  The Ansible playbook need not be called from the Vagrantfile.
